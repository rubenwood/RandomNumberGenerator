# Random Number Generators
Repo for a pseudo-random number generator I have created

# GARandom.js
This is a quick pseudo-random number generator created in javascript, inside you'll find the full source which includes the function for generating a pseudo-random number and a small test case at the bottom.

GA in GARandom, stands for Golden Angle, it uses the Golden Angle (137.508) to generate the pseudo-random number

Will be refined at a later date
